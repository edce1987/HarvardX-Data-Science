#Key points
#The most common tasks in string processing include:
#  extracting numbers from strings
#removing unwanted characters from text
#finding and replacing characters
#extracting specific parts of strings
#converting free form text to more uniform formats
#splitting strings into multiple values
#The stringr package in the tidyverse contains string processing functions that follow a similar naming format (str_functionname) and are compatible with the pipe.

#Key points
#Define a string by surrounding text with either single quotes or double quotes.
#To include a single quote inside a string, use double quotes on the outside. To include a double quote inside a string, use single quotes on the outside.
#The cat() function displays a string as it is represented inside R.
#To include a double quote inside of a string surrounded by double quotes, use the backslash (\) to escape the double quote. Escape a single quote to include it inside of a string defined by single quotes.
#We will see additional uses of the escape later.

s <- "Hello!"    # double quotes define a string
s <- 'Hello!'    # single quotes define a string
s <- `Hello`    # backquotes do not

#s <- "10""    # error - unclosed quotes
s <- '10"'    # correct

# cat shows what the string actually looks like inside R
cat(s)

s <- "5'"
cat(s)

# to include both single and double quotes in string, escape with \
#s <- '5'10"'    # error

#Key points
#The main types of string processing tasks are detecting, locating, extracting and replacing elements of strings.
#The stringr package from the tidyverse includes a variety of string processing functions that begin with str_ and take the string as the first argument, which makes them compatible with the pipe.

#In the raw heights data, many students did not report their height as the number of inches as requested. There are many entries with real height information but in the wrong format, which we can extract with string processing. 
#When there are both text and numeric entries in a column, the column will be a character vector. Converting this column to numeric will result in NAs for some entries.
#To correct problematic entries, look for patterns that are shared across large numbers of entries, then define rules that identify those patterns and use these rules to write string processing tasks.

#Key points
#A regular expression (regex) is a way to describe a specific pattern of characters of text. A set of rules has been designed to do this specifically and efficiently.
#stringr functions can take a regex as a pattern.
#str_detect() indicates whether a pattern is present in a string.
#The main difference between a regex and a regular string is that a regex can include special characters.
#The | symbol inside a regex means "or".
#Use '\\d' to represent digits. The backlash is used to distinguish it from the character 'd'. In R, you must use two backslashes for digits in regular expressions; in some other languages, you will only use one backslash for regex special characters.
#str_view() highlights the first occurrence of a pattern, and the str_view_all() function highlights all occurrences of the pattern.

#Key points
#Define strings to test your regular expressions, including some elements that match and some that do not. This allows you to check for the two types of errors: failing to match and matching incorrectly.
#Square brackets define character classes: groups of characters that count as matching the pattern. You can use ranges to define character classes, such as [0-9] for digits and [a-zA-Z] for all letters.
#Anchors define patterns that must start or end at specific places. ^ and $ represent the beginning and end of the string respectively.
#Curly braces are quantifiers that state how many times a certain character can be repeated in the pattern. \\d{1,2} matches exactly 1 or 2 consecutive digits.

####Theory
#Four clear patterns of entries have arisen along with some other minor problems:
#  
#  Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. For example, 6' - our pattern requires that inches be included.
#Some students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet entered just that number.
#Some of the inches were entered with decimal points. For example 5'7.5''. Our pattern only looks for two digits.
#Some entires have spaces at the end, for example 5 ' 9.
#Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: 1.6, 1,7.
#Two students added cm.
#One student spelled out the numbers: Five foot eight inches.
#It is not necessarily clear that it is worth writing code to handle all these cases since they might be rare enough. However, some give us an opportunity to learn some more regex techniques so we will build a fix.

#Case 1
#For case 1, if we add a '0 to, for example, convert all 6 to 6'0, then our pattern will match. This can be done using groups using the following code:
  
yes <- c("5", "6", "5")
no <- c("5'", "5''", "5'4")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([4-7])$", "\\1'0")
#The pattern says it has to start (^), be followed with a digit between 4 and 7, and then end there ($). The parenthesis defines the group that we pass as \\1 to the replace regex.

#Cases 2 and 4
#We can adapt this code slightly to handle case 2 as well which covers the entry 5'. Note that the 5' is left untouched by the code above. This is because the extra ' makes the pattern not match since we have to end with a 5 or 6. To handle case 2, we want to permit the 5 or 6 to be followed by no or one symbol for feet. So we can simply add '{0,1} after the ' to do this. We can also use the none or once special character ?. As we saw previously, this is different from * which is none or more. We now see that this code also handles the fourth case as well:

str_replace(s, "^([56])'?$", "\\1'0")
#Note that here we only permit 5 and 6 but not 4 and 7. This is because heights of exactly 5 and exactly 6 feet tall are quite common, so we assume those that typed 5 or 6 really meant either 60 or 72 inches. However, heights of exactly 4 or exactly 7 feet tall are so rare that, although we accept 84 as a valid entry, we assume that a 7 was entered in error.

#Case 3
#We can use quantifiers to deal with  case 3. These entries are not matched because the inches include decimals and our pattern does not permit this. We need allow the second group to include decimals and not just digits. This means we must permit zero or one period . followed by zero or more digits. So we will use both ? and *. Also remember that for this particular case, the period needs to be escaped since it is a special character (it means any character except a line break).
#
#So we can adapt our pattern, currently ^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$, to permit a decimal at the end:
  
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"
#Case 5
#Case 5, meters using commas, we can approach similarly to how we converted the x.y to x'y. A difference is that we require that the first digit is 1 or 2:

yes <- c("1,7", "1, 8", "2, " )
no <- c("5,8", "5,3,2", "1.7")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")
#We will later check if the entries are meters using their numeric values.

#Trimming
#In general, spaces at the start or end of the string are uninformative. These can be particularly deceptive because sometimes they can be hard to see:
#
s <- "Hi "
cat(s)
identical(s, "Hi")
#This is a general enough problem that there is a function dedicated to removing them: str_trim.

str_trim("5 ' 9 ")
#To upper and to lower case
#One of the entries writes out numbers as words: Five foot eight inches. Although not efficient, we could add 12 extra str_replace to convert zero to 0, one to 1, and so on. To avoid having to write two separate operations for Zero and zero, One and one, etc., we can use the str_to_lower() function to make all words lower case first:

s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)
#Putting it into a function
#We are now ready to define a procedure that handles converting all the problematic cases.

#We can now put all this together into a function that takes a string vector and tries to convert as many strings as possible to a single format. Below is a function that puts together the previous code replacements:

convert_format <- function(s){
  s %>%
    str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
str_replace_all("inches|in|''|\"|cm|and", "") %>%  #remove inches and other symbols
  str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") %>% #change x.y, x,y x y
  str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
  str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
  str_trim() #remove extra space
}
#We can also write a function that converts words to numbers:
  
words_to_numbers <- function(s){
    str_to_lower(s) %>%  
      str_replace_all("zero", "0") %>%
      str_replace_all("one", "1") %>%
      str_replace_all("two", "2") %>%
      str_replace_all("three", "3") %>%
      str_replace_all("four", "4") %>%
      str_replace_all("five", "5") %>%
      str_replace_all("six", "6") %>%
      str_replace_all("seven", "7") %>%
      str_replace_all("eight", "8") %>%
      str_replace_all("nine", "9") %>%
      str_replace_all("ten", "10") %>%
      str_replace_all("eleven", "11")
  }
#Now we can see which problematic entries remain:
  
converted <- problems %>% words_to_numbers %>% convert_format
remaining_problems <- converted[not_inches_or_cm(converted)]
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d+\\.?\\d*$"
index <- str_detect(remaining_problems, pattern)
remaining_problems[!index]

####Theory 2
#We are now ready to put everything we've done so far together and wrangle our reported heights data as we try to recover as many heights as possible. The code is complex but we will break it down into parts.
#
#We start by cleaning up the height column so that the heights are closer to a feet'inches format. We added an original heights column so we can compare before and after.
#
#Let's start by writing a function that cleans up strings so that all the feet and inches formats use the same x'y format when appropriate.
#
pattern <- "^([4-7])\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"

smallest <- 50
tallest <- 84
new_heights <- reported_heights %>% 
  mutate(original = height, 
         height = words_to_numbers(height) %>% convert_format()) %>%
  extract(height, c("feet", "inches"), regex = pattern, remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("height", "feet", "inches"), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(guess = 12*feet + inches) %>%
  mutate(height = case_when(
    !is.na(height) & between(height, smallest, tallest) ~ height, #inches 
    !is.na(height) & between(height/2.54, smallest, tallest) ~ height/2.54, #centimeters
    !is.na(height) & between(height*100/2.54, smallest, tallest) ~ height*100/2.54, #meters
    !is.na(guess) & inches < 12 & between(guess, smallest, tallest) ~ guess, #feet'inches
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) %>%
  select(-guess)
#We can check all the entries we converted using the following code:
  
  new_heights %>%
  filter(not_inches(original)) %>%
  select(original, height) %>% 
  arrange(height) %>%
  View()
#Let's take a look at the shortest students in our dataset using the following code:

new_heights %>% arrange(height) %>% head(n=7)
#We see heights of 53, 54, and 55. In the original heights column, we also have 51 and 52. These short heights are very rare and it is likely that the students actually meant 5'1, 5'2, 5'3, 5'4, and 5'5. But because we are not completely sure, we will leave them as reported.

####
#Key Points
#The function str_split() splits a string into a character vector on a delimiter (such as a comma, space or underscore). By default, str_split() generates a list with one element for each original string. Use the function argument simplify=TRUE to have str_split() return a matrix instead.
#The map() function from the purrr package applies the same function to each element of a list. To extract the ith entry of each element x, use map(x, i).

#One of the datasets provided in dslabs shows scientific funding rates by gender in the Netherlands:
  
library(dslabs)
data("research_funding_rates")
research_funding_rates 
#The data come from a paper External link published in the prestigious journal PNAS. However, the data are not provided in a spreadsheet; they are in a table in a PDF document. We could extract the numbers by hand, but this could lead to human error. Instead we can try to wrangle the data using R.
#
#Downloading the data
#We start by downloading the PDF document then importing it into R using the following code:
install.packages("pdftools")  
library("pdftools")
temp_file <- tempfile()
url <- "http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2015/09/16/1510159112.DCSupplemental/pnas.201510159SI.pdf"
download.file(url, temp_file)
txt <- pdf_text(temp_file)
file.remove(temp_file)
#If we examine the object text we notice that it is a character vector with an entry for each page. So we keep the page we want using the following code:
  
raw_data_research_funding_rates <- txt[2]
#The steps above can actually be skipped because we include the raw data in the dslabs package as well:

data("raw_data_research_funding_rates")
#Looking at the download
#Examining this object,

raw_data_research_funding_rates %>% head
#we see that it is a long string. Each line on the page, including the table rows, is separated by the symbol for newline: \n.

#We can therefore can create a list with the lines of the text as elements:
  
tab <- str_split(raw_data_research_funding_rates, "\n")
#Because we start off with just one element in the string, we end up with a list with just one entry:
  
tab <- tab[[1]]
#By examining this object,

tab %>% head
#we see that the information for the column names is the third and fourth entires:
  
the_names_1 <- tab[3]
the_names_2 <- tab[4]
#In the table, the column information is spread across two lines. We want to create one vector with one name for each column. We can do this using some of the functions we have just learned.

#Extracting the table data
#Let's start with the first line:

the_names_1
#We want to remove the leading space and everything following the comma. We can use regex for the latter. Then we can obtain the elements by splitting using the space. We want to split only when there are 2 or more spaces to avoid splitting success rate. So we use the regex \\s{2,} as follows:

the_names_1 <- the_names_1 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_replace_all(",\\s.", "") %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_1
#Now let's look at the second line:
  
the_names_2
#Here we want to trim the leading space and then split by space as we did for the first line:
  
the_names_2 <- the_names_2 %>%
str_trim() %>%
str_split("\\s+", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_2
#Now we can join these to generate one name for each column:
  
tmp_names <- str_c(rep(the_names_1, each = 3), the_names_2[-1], sep = "_")
the_names <- c(the_names_2[1], tmp_names) %>%
str_to_lower() %>%
str_replace_all("\\s", "_")
the_names
#Now we are ready to get the actual data. By examining the tab object, we notice that the information is in lines 6 through 14. We can use str_split() again to achieve our goal:
  
  new_research_funding_rates <- tab[6:14] %>%
  str_trim %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE) %>%
  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(the_names) %>%
  mutate_at(-1, parse_number)
new_research_funding_rates %>% head()
#We can see that the objects are identical:
  
identical(research_funding_rates, new_research_funding_rates)

#Key points
#Change long factor names with the recode() function from the tidyverse. 
#Other similar functions include recode_factor() and fct_recoder() in the forcats package in the tidyverse. The same result could be obtained using the case_when() function, but recode() is more efficient to write.

#Key points
#Dates are a separate data type in R.The tidyverse includes functionality for dealing with dates through the lubridate package. 
#Extract the year, month and day from a date object with the year(), month() and day() functions.
#Parsers convert strings into dates with the standard YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601 format). Use the parser with the name corresponding to the string format of year, month and day (ymd(), ydm(), myd(), mdy(), dmy(), dym()).
#Get the current time with the Sys.time() function. Use the now() function instead to specify a time zone.
#You can extract values from time objects with the hour(), minute() and second() functions.
#Parsers convert strings into times (for example, hms()). Parsers can also create combined date-time objects (for example, mdy_hms()).

#### Theory
#Key points
#The tidytext package helps us convert free form text into a tidy table.
#Use unnest_tokens() to extract individual words and other meaningful chunks of text.
#Sentiment analysis assigns emotions or a positive/negative score to tokens. You can extract sentiments using get_sentiments(). Common lexicons for sentiment analysis are "bing", "afinn", "nrc" and "loughran".

#With the exception of labels used to represent categorical data, we have focused on numerical data, but in many applications data starts as text. Well known examples are spam filtering, cyber-crime prevention, counter-terrorism and sentiment analysis.
#In all these examples, the raw data is composed of free form texts. Our task is to extract insights from these data. In this section, we learn how to generate useful numerical summaries from text data to which we can apply some of the powerful data visualization and analysis techniques we have learned.

#Case study: Trump Tweets
#During the 2016 US presidential election, then-candidate Donald J. Trump used his Twitter account as a way to communicate with potential voters. On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri tweeted External link about Trump that "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him)." Data scientist David Robinson conducted an analysis External link to determine if data supported this assertion. Here we go through David's analysis to learn some of the basics of text mining. To learn more about text mining in R we recommend this book External link.

#We notice a big peak for the Android in early hours of the morning, between 6 and 8 AM. There seems to be a clear different in these patterns. We will therefore assume that two different entities are using these two devices. Now we will study how their tweets differ. To do this we introduce the tidytext package.

#Text as data
#The tidytext package helps us convert free from text into a tidy table. Having the data in this format greatly facilitates data visualization and applying statistical techniques.

install.packages("tidytext")
library(tidytext)
#The main function needed to achieve this is unnest_tokens(). A token refers to the units that we are considering to be a data point. The most common tokens will be words, but they can also be single characters, ngrams, sentences, lines or a pattern defined by a regex. The functions will take a vector of strings and extract the tokens so that each one gets a row in the new table. Here is a simple example:

The functions will take a vector of strings and extract the tokens so that each one gets a row in the new table. Here is a simple example: 
example <- data_frame(line = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                      text = c("Roses are red,", "Violets are blue,", "Sugar is sweet,", "And so are you."))
example
example %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)

i <- 3008
campaign_tweets$text[i]
campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  select(word)

#Note that the function tries to convert tokens into words and strips characters important to twitter such as # and @. A token in twitter is not the same as in regular English. For this reason, instead of using the default token, words, we define a regex that captures twitter character. The pattern appears complex but all we are defining is a patter that starts with @, # or neither and is followed by any combination of letters or digits:
pattern <- "([^A-Za-z\\d#@']|'(?![A-Za-z\\d#@]))"

#We can now use the unnest_tokens() function with the regex option and appropriately extract the hashtags and mentions:
  
  campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  select(word)
#Another minor adjustment we want to make is remove the links to pictures:
  
  campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  select(word)
#Now we are ready to extract the words for all our tweets.

tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) 
#And we can now answer questions such as "what are the most commonly used words?"

tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
#It is not surprising that these are the top words. The top words are not informative. The tidytext package has database of these commonly used words, referred to as stop words, in text mining:
  
  stop_words
#If we filter out rows representing stop words with filter(!word %in% stop_words$word):
  
  tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word ) 
#We end up with a much more informative set of top 10 tweeted words:
  
  tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
#Some exploration of the resulting words (not show here) reveals a couple of unwanted characteristics in our tokens. First, some of our tokens are just numbers (years for example). We want to remove these and we can find them using the regex ^\d+$. Second, some of our tokens come from a quote and they start with '. We want to remove the ' when it's at the start of a word, so we will use str_replace(). We add these two lines to the code above to generate our final table:

tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word &
           !str_detect(word, "^\\d+$")) %>%
  mutate(word = str_replace(word, "^'", ""))
#Now that we have all our words in a table, along with information about what device was used to compose the tweet they came from, we can start exploring which words are more common when comparing Android to iPhone.

#For each word we want to know if it is more likely to come from an Android tweet or an iPhone tweet. We previously introduced the odds ratio, a summary statistic useful for quantifying these differences. For each device and a given word, let's call it y, we compute the odds or the ratio between the proportion of words that are y and not y and compute the ratio of those odds. Here we will have many proportions that are 0 so we use the 0.5 correction.

android_iphone_or <- tweet_words %>%
  count(word, source) %>%
  spread(source, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(or = (Android + 0.5) / (sum(Android) - Android + 0.5) / 
           ( (iPhone + 0.5) / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone + 0.5)))
android_iphone_or %>% arrange(desc(or))
android_iphone_or %>% arrange(or)
#Given that several of these words are overall low frequency words we can impose a filter based on the total frequency like this:

android_iphone_or %>% filter(Android+iPhone > 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))

android_iphone_or %>% filter(Android+iPhone > 100) %>%
  arrange(or)
#We already see somewhat of a pattern in the types of words that are being tweeted more in one device versus the other. However, we are not interested in specific words but rather in the tone. Vaziri's assertion is that the Android tweets are more hyperbolic. So how can we check this with data? Hyperbolic is a hard sentiment to extract from words as it relies on interpreting phrases. However, words can be associated to more basic sentiment such as as anger, fear, joy and surprise. In the next section we demonstrate basic sentiment analysis.

#Sentiment Analysis
#In sentiment analysis we assign a word to one or more "sentiment". Although this approach will miss context dependent sentiments, such as sarcasm, when performed on large numbers of words, summaries can provide insights.

#The first step in sentiment analysis is to assign a sentiment to each word. The tidytext package includes several maps or lexicons in the object sentiments:

sentiments 
#There are several lexicons in the tidytext package that give different sentiments. For example, the bing lexicon divides words into positive and negative. We can see this using the tidytext function get_sentiments():
install.packages("textdata")
get_sentiments("bing")
#The AFINN lexicon assigns a score between -5 and 5, with -5 the most negative and 5 the most positive.

get_sentiments("afinn")
#The loughran and nrc lexicons provide several different sentiments:

get_sentiments("loughran") %>% count(sentiment)
get_sentiments("nrc") %>% count(sentiment)
#To start learning about how these lexicons were developed, read this help file: ?sentiments.

#For the analysis here we are interested in exploring the different sentiments of each tweet, so we will use the nrc lexicon:

nrc <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  select(word, sentiment)
#We can combine the words and sentiments using inner_join(), which will only keep words associated with a sentiment. Here are 10 random words extracted from the tweets:

tweet_words %>% inner_join(nrc, by = "word") %>% 
  select(source, word, sentiment) %>% sample_n(10)
#Now we are ready to perform a quantitative analysis comparing Android and iPhone by comparing the sentiments of the tweets posted from each device. Here we could perform a tweet by tweet analysis, assigning a sentiment to each tweet. However, this somewhat complex since each tweet will have several sentiments attached to it, one for each word appearing in the lexicon. For illustrative purposes, we will perform a much simpler analysis: we will count and compare the frequencies of each sentiment appears for each device.

sentiment_counts <- tweet_words %>%
  left_join(nrc, by = "word") %>%
  count(source, sentiment) %>%
  spread(source, n) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = replace_na(sentiment, replace = "none"))
sentiment_counts
#Because more words were used on the Android than on the phone:

tweet_words %>% group_by(source) %>% summarize(n = n())
#for each sentiment we can compute the odds of being in the device: proportion of words with sentiment versus proportion of words without and then compute the odds ratio comparing the two devices:

sentiment_counts %>%
  mutate(Android = Android / (sum(Android) - Android) , 
         iPhone = iPhone / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone), 
         or = Android/iPhone) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))
#So we do see some difference and the order is interesting: the largest three sentiments are disgust, anger, and negative! But are they statistically significant? How does this compare if we are just assigning sentiments at random?

#To answer that question we can compute, for each sentiment, an odds ratio and confidence interval. We will add the two values we need to form a two-by-two table and the odds ratio:

library(broom)
log_or <- sentiment_counts %>%
  mutate( log_or = log( (Android / (sum(Android) - Android)) / (iPhone / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone))),
          se = sqrt( 1/Android + 1/(sum(Android) - Android) + 1/iPhone + 1/(sum(iPhone) - iPhone)),
          conf.low = log_or - qnorm(0.975)*se,
          conf.high = log_or + qnorm(0.975)*se) %>%
  arrange(desc(log_or))
  
log_or
#A graphical visualization shows some sentiments that are clearly overrepresented:

log_or %>%
  mutate(sentiment = reorder(sentiment, log_or),) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_errorbar() +
  geom_point(aes(sentiment, log_or)) +
  ylab("Log odds ratio for association between Android and sentiment") +
  coord_flip() 
#We see that the disgust, anger, negative sadness and fear sentiments are associated with the Android in a way that is hard to explain by chance alone. Words not associated to a sentiment were strongly associated with the iPhone source, which is in agreement with the original claim about hyperbolic tweets.

#If we are interested in exploring which specific words are driving these differences, we can back to our android_iphone_or object:

android_iphone_or %>% inner_join(nrc) %>%
  filter(sentiment == "disgust" & Android + iPhone > 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))
#We can make a graph:
library(tidyverse)
android_iphone_or %>% inner_join(nrc, by = "word") %>%
  mutate(sentiment = factor(sentiment, levels = log_or$sentiment)) %>%
  mutate(log_or = log(or)) %>%
  filter(Android + iPhone > 10 & abs(log_or)>1) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, log_or)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, log_or, fill = log_or < 0)) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_x", nrow = 2) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
